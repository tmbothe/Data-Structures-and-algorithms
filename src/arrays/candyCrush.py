Don't be intimidated by how long or ugly the code looks. Sometimes I fall into that trap. It's simpler than it seems.
Also, I would love feedback if this is helpful, or if there are any mistakes!

A key insight to the problem is to know that in order to make crushing the candies an easier process, you should store the locations of the board where a candy can be crushed in a separate data structure.

We will use a set called "crushable" and store coordinates of the board where a candy may be crushed

5 Main Steps.

Mark where the candies can be crushed horizontally
Loop through the board and check 3 spots at a time to see if there is the same character and that character isn't 0
Mark where the candies can be crushed vertically
Same thing, but vertically
Crush the candies
Go through the set of crushable locations, and edit the original board
Shift candies down if there are zeroes below them.
Pay attention to the columns. We will start from the bottom of the board, and work our way up, shifting the candies that were not crushed into their "fallen" position.
Find out where to determine whether or not a board's candies can be crushed anymore
If we loop through the entire board, and no candy was crushed, then we are finished.
Time: O(m * n) where m = rows and n = cols. Or you could say O(n) where n = every element in the board
- We must loop through the entire board no matter what

Space: O(n) where n is the total number of elements in the board
- In the worst case scenario, we store the locations of every spot on the board in the crushable set
